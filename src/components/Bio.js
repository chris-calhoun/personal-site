      <h3 className='intro'>Hi, I'm Chris</h3>
      <p>
        I am a part-time student at Nashville Software School (NSS) pursuing a
        career in software engineering. It has been a long winding road to get
        to this point, but I am incredibly thankful and excited to be here.

        After graduating with a degree in mechanical engineering, I worked in a
        variety of technical roles, including analyzing paint quality data,
        designing concert stages, and site planning hospital equipment. While
        each of these roles were very different, they all presented
        opportunities to automate and code. To make a long story short, I
        quickly fell in love with coding and now aspire to make a long term
        career out of it.

        Outside of school work and work work, I enjoy climbing, chess, and
        ultimate frisbee(!). Thanks for reading and feel free to contact me
        here!
